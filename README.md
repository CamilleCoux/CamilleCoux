**Hi!**

Thanks for your interest in my work !

Projects so far have dealt with subjects such as plant-pollinator network analyses, fruit consumption/dispersal by birds in New Zealand, and occupancy analyses from citizen observations of marine fauna. 

So far I've mainly used GLMs, mixed models, network analyses, occupancy analysis. I usually work in R, but I also have skills in other softwares like QGIS.

I am a generalist kind of ecologist, and I tend to be interested in all different kinds of topics and I get particularly excited whenever I get to work across disciplines, so I'd like that to happen more ! E.g., citizen science, geography, machine learning...

I would like to get some training in Bayesian statistics, that might be my next big project in here. Also more species distribution modeling.

In these repos you'll find codes for analyses that were linked to published papers, some side-projects, and some analyses I might still be working on :)
